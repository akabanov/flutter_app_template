# Localisation

## Automation

There are string management systems for managing translations: Lokalise, Crowdin, or POEditor.

### Lokalise:

If budget isn't a concern: Lokalise - most feature-rich but expensive.

- Strong Flutter/Dart support with official SDK
- Direct integration with .arb files used by intl
- Real-time preview of translations in app context
- Collaborative features for translators
- More expensive compared to alternatives
- Price: Starts at $90/month for Business plan

```yaml
# Example GitHub Action for auto-sync (not verified)
name: Sync Translations
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Sync with Lokalise
        run: lokalise2 --token ${{ secrets.LOKALISE_TOKEN }} download
```

### Crowdin:

- Native Flutter support
- Two-way sync with arb files
- Over-the-air (OTA) updates possible
- Strong QA tools for translators
- Good API documentation
- Price: Starts at $29/month

For larger teams/projects: Crowdin - better collaboration tools and reasonable pricing.

### POEditor:

For small to medium projects: POEditor - it's cost-effective and handles `intl` well without overwhelming features.

- Simpler interface, easier learning curve
- Direct .arb file support
- Good for smaller teams
- More affordable
- Fewer advanced features
- Price: Starts at $14/month

## In-house solution

Naive approach:

```yaml
dependencies:
  google_generative_ai: ^0.3.0
```

```dart
import 'package:google_generative_ai/google_generative_ai.dart';

class TranslationService {
  final model = GenerativeModel(
    model: 'gemini-pro',
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  );

  Future<String> translate(String text, String targetLang) async {
    final prompt = 'Translate this text to $targetLang: $text';
    final response = await model.generateContent(prompt);
    return response.text;
  }
}
```

Main challenges to consider:

- Cost: $0.00025 per 1k characters (as of January 2024)
- Rate limits: Default is 60 requests per minute
- You'll need error handling for: API failures, Rate limiting, and Character length restrictions
- Quality assurance - AI translations might need human review
- Need to handle formatting/placeholders carefully
