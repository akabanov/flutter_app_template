# New Flutter project template

This is a template for a new Flutter project with the instructions on how to set up common integrations.

I'm crafting this project for personal use with two objectives in mind:

* To be able to start new Flutter projects as quickly as possible
* Learn the process end-to-end

This template is available [UNLICENSED](LICENSE).

This template is designed to be used on Ubuntu.
While many bash snippets will work in other environments, some may require adaptation.

Follow [project setup guide](readme-setup.md) to get started.

See [reference material](readme-reference.md) for daily tasks.

## TODO

* learn how to retrieve test screenshots from Test Lab
* a script to put proper project, bundle and package names in place
