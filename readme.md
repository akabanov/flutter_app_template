# New Flutter project template

This is a template for a new Flutter project with the instructions on how to set up common integrations.

I'm crafting this project for personal use with two objectives in mind:

- To be able to start new Flutter projects as quickly as possible
- Learn the process end-to-end

This template is available [UNLICENSED](LICENSE).

The snippets and the setup script are designed for Ubuntu 24.04.
While some of these many may work in other environments, others may require tweaking.

Also, the instructions and the setup script assume the project is hosted on GitHub.
