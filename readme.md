# New Flutter project template

This is a template for a new Flutter project with the instructions on how to set up common integrations.

I'm crafting this project for personal use with two objectives in mind:

* To be able to start new Flutter projects as quickly as possible
* Learn the process end-to-end

This template is available [UNLICENSED](LICENSE).

This template is designed to be used on Ubuntu.
While many bash snippets will work in other environments, some may require adaptation.

See:

* [project setup guide](readme-setup.md) to get started
* [popular packages](readme-packages.md) to add pub packages
* [reference material](readme-shell-snippets.md) for frequently used shell snippets
* [graphic design](readme-graphic-design.md) for graphic design guidelines and resources

[Project console in GCloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome/new?project=flutter-app-template-445902).


## TODO

* learn how to retrieve test screenshots from Test Lab
* a script to put proper project, bundle and package names in place
